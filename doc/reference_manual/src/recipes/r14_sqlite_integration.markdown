# Recipe #14: integration of SQLITE databases

For physical quantity and chemical stoichiometry matching, MOSSCO integrates
a database of typical quantities and their relations.  This feature is used
in the new `soil_pelagic_mediator.F90`, that in turn depends on the `mossco_db.F90`.

This Recipe explains how to install the database.

to easily install them through a package manager.  If not, please proceed to the next section.
