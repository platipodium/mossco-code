@section what What is MOSSCO?

1. The Modular System for Shelves and Coasts.  
2. A coupling infrastructure that facilitates the coupling of heterogeneous software components describing aspects of the coastal Earth System. 
3. A project as well as a software system.
  
This user guide describes the software system MOSSCO.

@section can-use Can I use MOSSCO?

You can make good use of MOSSCO, if you are

1. A model developer or scientific computer engineer who would like to couple different models on high-performance computing architectures.
2. A scientific modeler with a specific model that should be integrated with other models.
3. An experimentalist who would like to make data available to the modeling community and have her data assimilated/used by computer models.


@section what-for What do we get funding for?

Goals and objectives from our funding proposal

@subsection goal Goal

> The overarching goal of the project Modular System for Shelves and Coasts (MOSSCO, <http://www.mossco.de>) is to bring together the distributed capacities in coastal ocean modelling in Germany and to build a common infrastructure for the national and international coastal research community.

@subection objectives Objectives

> 1. MOSSCO will build a framework for a modular data and model system, an infrastructure, which has been identified as research demand by the Forschungsagenda Nord- und Ostsee within framework of the Research Agenda for Sustainable Development (FONA, [www.fona.de](http://www.fona.de/ "Forschung für Nachhaltige Entwicklung")). 

> 2. MOSSCO integrates physical, biological, chemical and geological modules in an exchangeable way. This modular infrastructure supports synoptic studies of coastal and shelf seas including their interfaces to adjacent Earth-system components, such as sediment, atmosphere, rivers and the open ocean. Benefits of this approach are most apparent for the description of cohesive sediments where strong interactions between the benthic and pelagic compartment and between hydrodynamic, biogeochemical (BGC), ecological and sedimentary processes are largely unresolved within state-of-the-art models. 

> 3. MOSSCO will be applied to cohesive sediment dynamics and transport problems on two spatial coastal scales: In an application to the entire German North Sea and Baltic Sea, we will demonstrate the modular concept of MOSSCO, study sediment fluxes along the coast, and support other FONA projects. In a study of two estuaries, we will focus on the impact of maintenance dredging and channel deepening on water quality and ecosystem services, including potential effects of climate change. Using a webGIS frontend of the modular system, the estuarine results will be evaluated for their compliance with coastal policies.
