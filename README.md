This is the main directory of MOSSCO, also called `$MOSSCO_DIR`

To *quickly start*, read the file `QuickStart.md` or `QuickStart.pdf`

# Why MOSSCO?

MOSSCO, the "Modular System for Shelves and Coasts" is a framework for coupling
processes or domains that are originally developed in standalone numerical models.

The software MOSSCO implements this infrastructure in the form of a library of
components and couplers, and of example coupled applications.  The components
"wrap" external models used in coastal and shelf sciences, such as the Framework
for Aquatic Biogeochemistry (FABM), the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM),
or the Delft3D erosion model (EROSED).  These wrapped components are then coupled
to each other in the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF).

MOSSCO is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms

it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.  Consult the file

# What is here?

This main directory $MOSSCO_DIR contains four subdirectories

- `./src` for the library of drivers, components, and couplers.  You should not
have to change this unless you want to develop your own components;
- `./doc` for documentation. You really should read this or the online
documentation at <http://www.mossco.de/doc>;
- `./examples` for example applications to be used as templates.

## What is not here?

This directory produces only the libraries (from `./src`) and some example
executables (from `./examples`).  It does *not* contain forcing files or
parameters to run a scientifically usable simulation.   Please `git clone` the
separate repository located at `http://git.code.sf.net/p/mossco/setups` into a
directory of your choice (which you should point to with the environment
variable `$MOSSCO_SETUPDIR`).

# The documentation

To create the documentation with full installation instructions, type

		make doc

This generates a pdf file in `$MOSSCO_DIR/doc/mossco_reference_manual.pdf` and a
html version at `$MOSSCO_DIR/doc/reference_manual/html/index.html`. There is also
a pre-built online documentation at `http://www.mossco.de/doc` with detailed
installation instructions, if your system is missing latex/doxygen for building
the documentation yourself.

# Installation

To make the MOSSCO libraries, i.e. drivers, components, and utilities, you need
to have a compiled version of the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF), with
known location of the `esmf.mk` Makefile pointed to by the variable `$ESMFMKFILE`

Then, simply type

		make

To make some examples, type

		make examples

If you want to learn what you can do with MOSSCO examples, read the very short
tutorial in the file `$MOSSCO_DIR/QuickStart.md`

Should you encounter errors or annoyances (such that this just does not work out
of the box,  please consult the documentation, and visit the bugs database at
<http://www.mossco.de/bugs>.

More components and examples are built when external models, like FABM, GOTM,
GETM, or EROSED are installed  on your system. Please consult the documentation
for information on how to build MOSSCO with any of these external models. Or,
simply try

		make external

# Running an example

In the folder `$MOSSCO_DIR/examples/generic` several coupling specifications have
been compiled describing different coupled systems, see `QuickStart.md` to learn
quickly about one example.

The example executables should *not* be executed locally, but instead, you should
download/create a set of setups and run the examples within a setup.  Again, see
`QuickStart.md` or the full documentation for more information.
