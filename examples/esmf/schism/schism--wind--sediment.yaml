# description: "This test case describes a coupling between the SCHISM ocean
# component (containing a FABM pelagic ecosystem model) and the FABM component for
# the sediment (running OMExDia).  Wind input data on the CLM grid is read from
# file and regridded to SCHISM.  Ecosystem models are defined on the SCHISM grid
# and exchange data via the specific soil--pelagic and pelagic--soil connectors.
# As a fall back, static ecosystem data is provided by the default component. Output
# occurs on both the mesh as well as the
