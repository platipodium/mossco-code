- The MOSSCO project is funded primarly by the German Ministry for Education and
  Research (BMBF) in the frame of its Coastal research agenda North and Baltic Sea
  (KÃ¼NO) within the Research Agenda for Sustainability (FONA).

- The participating institutes---HZG, IOW, and BAW---all contribute with
  institutional funding to the success of MOSSCO.

- The Friends of Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht helped finance the Modular Coupling
  Workshop held in 2013.

- The MOSSCO web site and development platform is hosted on Sourceforge (<http://sf.net>)
  for free.  We thank the sponsors of this site for enabling this service to operate.

- MOSSCO makes use of many free and open source software projects, among  them
  the GNU project (<http://www.gnu.org>) and the Earth System Modeling Framework
  (<http://www.earthsystemmodeling.org>), the Python scripting language
  (<https://www.python.org>) and the Inkscape vector drawing program (<https://inkscape.org>).

- In particular we express our thanks to the developers of the various models
  integrated into MOSSCO. Without their continuous effort to provide state-of-the-art
  model code to the community, the MOSSCO project would be impossible. Currently,
  MOSSCO integrates:

  - the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (<http://sf.net/projects/fabm>),
  - the General Ocean Turbulence Model (<http://www.gotm.net>),
  - the General Estuarine Transport Model (<http://www.getm.eu>),
  - the SandMudBedModule from the OpenEarthTools (<http://www.openearth.nl>).

MOSSCO is mainly developed on Ubuntu Linux workstations and macOS laptops using the MacPorts distribution.
