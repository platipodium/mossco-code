- The MOSSCO project is funded primarly by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) in the frame of its Coastal research agenda North and Baltic Sea (KüNO) within the Research Agenda for Sustainability (FONA).

- The participating institutes---HZG, IOW, and BAW---all contribute with institutional funding to the success of MOSSCO.

- The Friends of Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht helped finance the Modular Coupling Workshop held in 2013.

- The MOSSCO web site and development platform is hosted on Sourceforge (<http://sf.net>) for free.  We thank the sponsors of this site for enabling this service to operate.

- MOSSCO makes use of many free and open source software projects, among  them the GNU project (<http://www.gnu.org>) and the Earth System Modeling Framework (<http://www.earthsystemmodeling.org>), the Python scripting language (<https://www.python.org>) and the Inkscape vector drawing program (<https://inkscape.org>).

- In particular we express our thanks to the developers of the various models integrated into MOSSCO. Without their continuous effort to provide state-of-the-art model code to the community, the MOSSCO project would be impossible. Currently MOSSCO integrates:
  - the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (<http://sf.net/projects/fabm>),
  - the General Ocean Turbulence Model (<http://www.gotm.net>),
  - the General Estuarine Transport Model (<http://www.getm.eu>),
  - the SandMudBedModule from the OpenEarthTools (<http://www.openearth.nl>).

MOSSCO is mainly developed on Ubuntu Linux workstations.
